# Project 02 Sound Machine

## Overview
Our second project will be do design sound machine that makes noise, tones, music, etc. By touching things (capacitance).

First lets frame some main ideas for our project

- What type of machine I want to make? (check inspiration projects)
- What is [capacitance](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/circuits-topic/circuits-with-capacitors/v/capacitors-and-capacitance), and what objects or materials can I use for this?
- What shape or instrument do I want to make?
- What materials do I need to make my sound machine?
- What makes my sound machine special or different?

## Inspiration

Check this cool projects:

- [Rocket Lamp](https://learn.adafruit.com/cpx-rocket-lamp)
- [hacking an ikea lamp](https://learn.adafruit.com/hacking-ikea-lamps-with-circuit-playground-express)  
- [Dragon Lamp](https://learn.adafruit.com/dragon-lamp)
- [Adventure Time Lamp](https://learn.adafruit.com/adventure-time-coffee-cup-lamp)
- [Lego Lamp](https://learn.adafruit.com/lego-head-lamp-with-audio)

## Activities

- Draw a sketch for your Sound Machine
- Draw a flow diagram for your Sound Machine's functionality
- Program the circuit playground to react make sounds according to the capacitive inputs.
- Make a prototype for your Sound Machine, test different materials, put all the parts together.
- Test and observe
- Make changes in your code or/and your prototype
- Repeat the last two steps as needed.
- Try to play a song with your new Instrument.

## Reflect and share

 - What did I discovered by doing this project?
 - What did I wish I new before this project?
 - What was the most difficult part and how I overcame it?
 - What do I love from this project?
 - What do I want to improve in this project.

 Take some pictures of your project and share it on a presentation or video, try to use as little text as possible and tell the story of how you got where you are with your project.

## Take your project to the next level

Think about an extra added value for your lamp:
  - Think about making some Art with it
  - Project cool shadows or silhouettes
  - Make  it react to the user's "Mood"
  - If you have a Bluefruit try to control it with your phone with Bluetooth
  - What could I do to my lamp that solves someones problem?

## Further Learning

- Research origami and unfolded shapes
- Research transparent, translucent and diffuse materials.
- Research 3D printing materials with translucent properties.
- Research Smart Lights and how they work.
